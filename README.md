# SoulBOT â€” A Chat Bot with a Soul!

Welcome to the work in progress that is SoulBOT, a NodeJS bot that can integrate with Discord or Slack.  The main feature of SoulBOT is its soul, which allows you to give your bot a personality.  Will yours be friendly?  Snarky?  Shy?  The possibilities are as endless as your imagination!

## Warning

This project has been completely rebuilt and currently only has basic functionality to connect, receive messages, and send messages.  Development is active but in my spare time; this is a pet project.  I am not available to provide tech support or to help you get a bot working on your own server.

## Installation

SoulBOT requires **node.js 8.0.0 or newer**.

``npm install ktrzonkowski/master``

## Todo

In no particular order, and definitely not comprehensive
- Add proper README with installation/usage instructions and examples
- Add more features!
- Comments!
